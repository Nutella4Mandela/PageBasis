# PageBasis
A sample web page I made to understand how a webpage works and to make my own in the future. Most of it is just testing out my 
ability and not worrying too much about designing it since it was just coding it. I didn't even care too much about optimizing it and 
organizing it. I'm glad that everything worked well as it did for my first time in actually developing a webpage. I'm very excited in
what I'm capable of and very confident to know more about this stuff. I made this in Visual Studios 2017! I used ASP.Net, CSS, C#, and 
Javascript!

# HomePage
The first thing I did was make a MasterPage that can help me navigate through the menu without rewriting everything in another asp file. 
I've also added two themes that can change whenever you go through the dropdown button to make it have more character and to 
learn ahead if I need to make themes for my webpages. There's not really much in the HomePage besides telling you what things do. 
I didn't update it as much as you can tell, but I'm glad everything worked as it should.

# ProductPage
This page took me a bit to make, but I've learned a good amount of things! The first thing I did with this page is make a ascx file inside 
the ProductPage.aspx file with an update panel. I put most of the code into the control file. This page is about an example of showing a 
product with different types of files. I've used JQuery to animate the image files and I used the txt file to add a description. This is to test 
what I can do with different files that aren't code-based. I've also used the Update progress to make a project template that says "Please 
Wait" everytime you click on one of the thumbnails.

# WebService
This page is a test to check if there would be a notification on the top of the screen. I used JQuery to make this and made an alert notification if
there's an issue with you not making any input. Again, pretty simple stuff, but efficient enough to know what it does.

# AboutUs

Again, nothing much on this page either...
