# PageBasis
A sample web page I made to understand how a webpage works and to make my own in the future. Most of it is just testing out my 
ability and not worrying too much about designing it since it was just coding it. I didn't even care too much about optimizing it and 
organizing it. I'm glad that everything worked well as it did for my first time in actually developing a webpage. I'm very excited in
what I'm capable of and very confident to know more about this stuff. I made this in Visual Studios 2017! I used ASP.Net, CSS, C#, and 
Javascript!

# HomePage
The first thing I did was make a MasterPage that can help me navigate through the menu without rewriting everything in another asp file. 
I've also added two themes that can change whenever you go through the dropdown button to make it have more character and to 
learn ahead if I need to make themes for my webpages. There's not really much in the HomePage besides telling you what things do. 
I didn't update it as much as you can tell, but I'm glad everything worked as it should.
